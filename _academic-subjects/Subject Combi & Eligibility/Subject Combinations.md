### **Subject Combinations**
Students must fulfil the stated subject combination eligibility criteria, subject pre-requisites or possess the assumed knowledge in order to offer the respective subjects.

#### **Important Note:**
1\) If a subject or subject combination is oversubscribed, students will be selected based on academic merit. (see section onÂ [Merit Based Allocation](https://staging.d3u4ang3g4zqzw.amplifyapp.com/academic-subjects/subject-combi-and-eligibility/subject-combination-eligibility-criteria/)

2\) In the event that there is insufficient subscription for a particular subject or subject combination, the college reserves the right not to offer that subject or subject combination.
